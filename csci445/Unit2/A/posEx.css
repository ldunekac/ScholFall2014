(1) The "shy" text should be partially hidden by the sidebar
(3) The important text should have an absolute position so that it appears toward the top right of the screen. It should have a scrollbar.
(2) The not-important text should not display the overflow.
(3) The more-important text should display the overflow. BUT, it should set z-index so that it appears behind the not-important text. Use relative position so that the more-important and not-important divs overlap somewhat.
(4) Use different colors for the four divs and another color for the text color in the sidebar div
